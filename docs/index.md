Index fund investing is a popular, 
[well-regarded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett#Investment_philosophy)
way to grow your wealth over time. Many companies offer services called "robo-advisors" that help
you choose a portfolio and automatically invest new funds. However, these services either charge
fees or force you to use their own, often expensive, index funds.

We believe that the value provided by robo-advisors does not warrant these costs. That's where Open
Robo comes in. It runs in your browser on top of widely respected and extremely cheap
[Vanguard](https://investor.vanguard.com/home/) investment platform. You don't pay any fees, ever.
